Today is the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birthday. I realized this at 2:30 AM because it is a random fact that I can't get out of my mind. ☺ I have off today and tomorrow from work so I hope to get some stuff done. 

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

My sleep schedule is starting to be more regular and I'm starting to get 'used to' my new shift.
