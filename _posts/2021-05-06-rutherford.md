# Words üìÑ

Today has been a pretty great day off. I went shopping for shoes and found a great deal so I got a new pair of running shoes and a new pair of work shoes. I also started watching Rutherford Falls on Peacock and I am loving this show. I took today off from school work so it was nice to have a day of leisure. (For the past few weeks, I've worked 5 10-hour shifts and this week I don't have to work mandatory overtime, so I'm enjoying my extra day off). I'm getting used to my new routine and I'm definitely starting to feel more grounded and more like I'm ready to move on. I miss Sparrow, though, and I hope sometime in the near future to figure out some things and hopefully I can find a place and reunite with her soon. I'm *so* over many parts (and people) right now in this 'chapter of my life'. 
## What Went Well? What Is Next? ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I took notes throughout my breaks and lunches this week at work. It's been hard to study while working third shift and working a lot, but I am proud of myself for doing it. I'm paying my own way through school and I know the value of education and because my current job isn't great, I feel extra motivated to study hard and finish school so I can have a great life for myself (and Sparrow). 

### Moments of Happiness ü•∞

Last night/early this morning, the line was shut down at work for the last 45 minutes and so I had a chance to actually get to talk to some of my co-workers and get to meet them. One of my co-workers is an immigrant from Morocco and he is super nice. We talked about soccer because I noticed he was wearing a 'Nike F.C' shirt. Another co-worker is originally from the inner cities and he worked as a wildfire fighter while in college and he went to school for forestry, despite never camping or being in the woods before his studies. He also has a 6-month old grandchild who he has never met because of the pandemic. Despite my job being awful in a lot of ways, one thing I really like about it, is that there are so many people of different ages and races. My current city is so white, bland, and people are very judgemental -- that it makes me so happy to meet and chat with co-workers from different backgrounds and experiences.
