# Words 📄

I took two short walks today and I felt great afterwards. 🚶‍♀️ I'm also learning to say "no" more when people ask me for things that are not mine to deal with. I'm making sure that my boundaries are not pushed and I'm not letting others get to me. 🤗

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I made some progress with my [project](https://github.com/TanyaSelvog/wellness-app). I realized that I need to break down work and if the issue still seems too big, then I need to break it down more because then it is easier to figure out. 

### Moments of Happiness 🥰

I'm listening to [Stamped from the Beginning](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/stamped) by [Ibram X. Kendi](https://www.ibramxkendi.com) and it is really eye-opening. I am loving this book and I would like to read his other works in the future.
