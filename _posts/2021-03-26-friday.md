# Words 📄

I took a morning nap and then I worked on my [project](https://github.com/TanyaSelvog/wellness-app). It has not been a very exciting day... 

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I'm making progress on my project and I'm doing so by breaking it down into managable chunks. I'm also taking lots of breaks and giving myself a lot of mental breaks, considering everything that is happening. 

### Moments of Happiness 🥰

Listening to Nicole Byer's podcast, Why Won't You Date Me? and watching Nora from Queens on HBO Max.
