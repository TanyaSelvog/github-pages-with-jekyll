# Words 📄

After calling way too many places, I finally found a healthcare provider in my area. It was such a frustrating experience but I think this provider will work out and that makes me happy. I realized on the best of days, I feel frustrated and on the worst of days, I just want to tell everyone to f*** off. I'm also trying to hard to stay focused and to let myself just grieve over everything.  

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I took a couple of days off from coding but now I'm getting back into it and working on CSS changes. 

### Moments of Happiness 🥰

I walked 3 miles this morning and saw the sun come up. I also saw a deer running in some tall grassy areas. Although it was dark out, I saw the animal's white tail and immediately knew it was a deer. 🦌
