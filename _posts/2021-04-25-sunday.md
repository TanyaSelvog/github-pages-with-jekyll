# Words 📄

Next week begins my school term and I'm looking forward to it. At work, I spent most of my evening thinking about what I'd like my work/school schedule to be like. I thought about making the first day of each work week the day that I think about what my goals are for the week and what I can do to be successful with them. 

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I managed to work a 10-hour shift on one hour of sleep and I'm considering that a success. I'm also going to be napping now and I hope I won't be in that predicament again anytime soon. 😴

### Moments of Happiness 🥰

The last hour of work went by pretty fast so that made me really happy.
