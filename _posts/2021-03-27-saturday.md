# Words 📄

It is frustrating to witness people laugh at others who are learning. It is especially frustrating to see it happen and having the people not realize what they are doing. 😤 

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I still working on my [Wellness Project](https://github.com/TanyaSelvog/wellness-app). I have been struggling with some CSS stuff, but I'm feeling more confident with documentation and figuring stuff out. I also think I'm going to break the wellness dimensions into more React components and I'll see where that takes me. 

### Moments of Happiness 🥰

I showed my mom an episode of Nailed It, and she really liked it. 

### Currently Watching 📺

There is a new season of Nailed It on Netflix and I already burned through all the episodes. I am currently watching Rosanna Pansino's Baketopia show on HBOMax.
