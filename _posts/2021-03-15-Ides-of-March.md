# Words 📄

I have lots of thoughts and few of them are written down. 😉

## Iterations 🦸‍♀️

I'd like to continue to learn more about Jekyll themes and how to customize a theme. I feel unsure about what I'm doing 🤷‍♀️ but I also feel that I confident enough that I can get out of my tech-comfort zone so I can achieve what I want. 

I'm currently reading through [Usability & Web Accessibility](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/headings) about headings because accessilibity is very important to me. I want to learn best practices so anyone can use whatever projects I make. Right now, I'm anxious that I'll mess up and I feel like I want to give up before I start because I'm not 'good enough'. If I focus on just small steps and break down large goals, I know I'll make progress. 

Ulitimately, I want to make projects that are accessible to everyone. 

## Moments of Happiness 🥰

I rediscovered a couple of podcasts, including [Pod Save the People](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-the-people/) and [Keep It](https://crooked.com/podcast-series/keep-it/). 🎧
