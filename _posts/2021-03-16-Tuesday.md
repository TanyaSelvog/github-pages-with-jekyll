# Words 📄

Today has been frustrating. I'm physically exhausted and I'm tired of dealing with challenges in a discouraging environment. 

The other day, I realized that my hometown is very disappointing and sad. I've seen a lot of toxic patriarchy and institutional racism. It is very depressing to be in an environment that is unhealthy in so many ways. Passive aggression, shaming others, fear of the unknown, etc., are the foundation of this area, and I hate it. **I hate it here.** 

I won't let this area get me down. (I **can't** let it get me down).  I will focus on my needs and my self-care. I'm strong. I'm self-aware. I will rise up. 

## Iterations 🦸‍♀️

I'm starting a new GitHub Lab - [Commuicating Using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown) today.


### Moments of Happiness 🥰
