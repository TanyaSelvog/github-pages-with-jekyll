# Words 📄

Today has been frustrating. I'm tired of dealing with various life challenges. I'm tired of feeling pulled down by my environment. 

The other day, I realized that my hometown is very disappointing and sad. I've seen a lot of toxic patriarchy and institutional racism. It is very depressing to be in an environment that is unhealthy and fosters shame and fear. **I hate it here.** 

I hate it here, but I won't let that get me down. I won't be pulled down by the systems. I will stay grounded and continue to focus on my needs and wants, and continue to take my self-care. I'm strong. I'm self-aware. I will rise up. 

## Iterations 🦸‍♀️

I'm starting a new GitHub Lab - [Commuicating Using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown) today.


### Moments of Happiness 🥰
