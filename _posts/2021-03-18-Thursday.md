# Words 📄

I'm very tired and have not been able to sleep for more than 5 hours at a time for the past few months. I feel like Grumpy Cat (_RIP Grumpy Cat_). 

## ~~Iterations~~   What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I went on a walk this afternoon. It was my first walk in a few days. It was windy, but it was nice to be outside. 


### Moments of Happiness 🥰

I came up with an idea for a project and I'm excited to get started on it.
