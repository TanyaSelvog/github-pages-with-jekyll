# Words 📄

Today I finally was okay with sharing my recent experience with others. I also ate a number of KitKats, watched streamers play Fall Guys on Twitch for a number of hours, and found a new book on Libby. I didn't code or exercise and I'm fine with that.

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I took a nap today and was able to sleep for an hour or so. I felt so much better after my nap, so I'm going to make sure to keep this in mind for the future.

### Moments of Happiness 🥰

The moment I woke up from my nap and felt rested for the first time in a long time.
