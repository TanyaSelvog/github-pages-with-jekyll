It's sunny and nice outside. I visited the library today and got a few books that I'm really looking forward to reading. One of the books involves LEGO MOCs and Shakespeare stories. 🤗

I took a break this afternoon and played Hearthstone for the first time in a few months. I'm trying to branch out and rediscover interests and things that make me happy.
