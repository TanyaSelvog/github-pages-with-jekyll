# Words 📄

 I read this quote from Beyoncé late last night and I really love it, "If everything was perfect, you would never learn and you would never grow." 

 I often feel like I have to be perfect when I try things and if I make a mistake, then it means I have failed. I know this is not true because I have a growth mindset. I can continue to work past my boundaries and comfort zone and I will continue to make mistakes but I will learn and I will grow from them. 🌺

## ~~Iterations~~   What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I completed this [lab](https://github.com/TanyaSelvog/node-express-course) on Node.js & Express. I'm going to find more labs/tutorials on Node so I can get comfy with it. 


### Moments of Happiness 🥰

I turned on [Instafluff's stream](https://www.twitch.tv/instafluff) while studying today. I really like their channel because it is positive and welcoming.
