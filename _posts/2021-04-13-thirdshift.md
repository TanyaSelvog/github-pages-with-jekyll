# Words 📄

I'm exhausted. I just finished my 2nd day of my 2nd week of working third shift. My body is not fully used to working overnight, but I feel like with each passing day I'm getting more used to my new schedule. Ideally I want to figure out when the best time for studying is, etc. 

## What Went Well? What Is Next? 🦸‍♀️

I have not worked on any projects since I started working, but I took notes yesterday on React basics. 

### Moments of Happiness 🥰

The sky was pretty as I drove home this morning. The sun was beginning to rise and there were shades of purple and pink and everything looked so pretty.
